# ERC-4337 Execution Clients

A repository for building Geth and other EVM execution clients with native ERC-4337 tracers.

## Pre-built docker images

Pre-built docker images are available at the following repositories. The tags correlate to the execution client's commit ref that the tracer was compiled with.

- [go-ethereum](https://hub.docker.com/r/stackupwallet/go-ethereum/tags)
- [nitro](https://hub.docker.com/r/stackupwallet/nitro/tags)
- [op-geth](https://hub.docker.com/r/stackupwallet/op-geth/tags)
- [base-node](https://hub.docker.com/r/stackupwallet/base-node/tags)

## Building binaries from source

Alternatively, you can build all binaries from source by cloning this repository.

### Git clone

Note that this repository uses git submodules to build execution clients based on a pinned release version. Make sure to include the `--recurse-submodules` flag in your git clone command.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/stackup-wallet/erc-4337-execution-client-builder.git
```

### Prerequisites

Most clients will require the following system dependencies to successfully compile:

- Go 1.21

### Running the build scripts

Use the following scripts to build a client from source with native ERC-4337 tracers included.

`$CLIENT` can be replaced with one of the currently supported execution clients:

- `go-ethereum`
- `bor`
- `nitro`
- `op-geth`
- `base-node`
- `bsc`
- `avalanchego`

```bash
./build_scripts/$CLIENT.sh
```

**All binaries will be available in the `./builds/$CLIENT` directory.**
